# Go Now

Go Now is a Go CLI application to sync ServiceNow code locally.

## Why?

This project was conceived of for two reasons:

1. I wanted to edit code in any editor and not be restricted to either the on platform editor or Visual Studio Code using the vscode extension.
2. I wanted an easy way to store my ServiceNow code in a Git repo.
